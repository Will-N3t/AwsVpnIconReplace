Clone this repo and run the `runme.command` script by double clicking it to update your AWS VPN icons to be less intrusive

The script will at one point pause, and ask you to click+drag a file from a `Finder` window that it opens, onto the AWS VPN app icon in the `Info` window that it also opens. Watch the video closely to see how this is done.

You can then return to the script and press any key to finish the process.
